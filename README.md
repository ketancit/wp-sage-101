### Theme installation

Install Sage using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```shell
$ composer create-project cit/wp-sage-101 theme-name/

$ yarn
$ yarn build
```

During theme installation you will have options to update `style.css` theme headers, select a CSS framework, and configure Browsersync.

## WP Sage 101 and Conscience Information Technologies
[Conscience Information Technologies](https://conscienceit.com) believes in [12 Factor](https://12factor.net/) methodology for web development. 

So to meet with this methodology, Conscience is creating it's own toolchain for [Wordpress Services](https://conscienceit2018.wixsite.com/website-1/copy-of-moodle) provided by Conscience Information Technologies. **WP Sage 101** is one of the tools of Conscience Information Technologies. See the image below:

</p>
 
So 'WP Sage 101' is based on the starter theme provided by [Roots](https://roots.io/sage/). By default, there is almost no styling in the theme. So taking this starter theme as a framework, Conscience has come up with 'WP Sage 101' with some basic look and features.
